Most people forget 90% of what they read within a week. OpenPriors helps you **capture**, **process**, and **integrate** knowledge from books, podcasts, articles, and conversations into your actual daily life — so learning sticks.

Built for intellectuals, lifelong learners, and knowledge workers who consume endlessly but struggle to apply what they learn.

## The Problem

You read a great book. You highlight passages. You feel inspired. Two weeks later, you can't remember the key ideas — let alone practice them.

OpenPriors closes the gap between **knowing** and **doing**.

## How It Works

```
1. Capture    →  Upload a book, paste a URL, or talk about what you learned
2. Extract    →  AI distills actionable principles from your material
3. Synthesize →  AI agents help you connect learnings to your real life
4. Practice   →  Goals with due dates, Slack reminders, and check-ins
```

## Features

| | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Capture** | Multi-source input | Upload PDFs, paste YouTube/article links, or voice-record what you learned |
| | Socratic voice Q&A | AI asks follow-up questions to deepen your understanding |
| **Process** | AI extraction | Automatically extracts actionable principles from any source |
| | Semantic search | Hybrid BM25 + vector search across all your materials |
| | LLM formatting | Raw content auto-formatted into structured markdown |
| **Integrate** | Osmosis sessions | AI explores your knowledge and proposes ways to integrate it |
| | Specialized agents | Reflection, Planner, Coach, Writer, and Helper agents |
| | Practice plans | Interactive plans with date pickers and goal tracking |
| **Connect** | Slack integration | Goal reminders and check-ins via Slack |
| **Own** | Local-first | SQLite database — your data stays on your machine |
| | BYOK | Bring your own API key (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic) |
| | Themeable UI | Customize background, fonts, and colors |

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, Node.js 20+

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/zixi-liu/openpriors.git
cd openpriors

# Setup — pick your LLM provider and paste your API key
python setup.py

# Install frontend
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# Start
python app.py
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown in your terminal and start learning.

## Agent System

OpenPriors uses a multi-agent architecture. An **Explore agent** reasons about your knowledge and routes to specialized sub-agents:

| Agent | Role | How it works |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Explore** | Router + knowledge search | Searches your materials, finds connections, proposes integration options |
| **Reflection** | Socratic coach | Walks you through 3-4 probing questions, generates a written reflection |
| **Planner** | Practice designer | Creates goal-based plans with cadence and due dates, saved to DB |
| **Coach** | Roleplay partner | Sets up scenarios to practice applying what you learned |
| **Writer** | Essay guide | Collaborative writing to articulate your learning |
| **Helper** | Free-form | Listens to what you need, searches your knowledge, helps directly |
