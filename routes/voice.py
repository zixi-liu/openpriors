The user just recorded themselves talking about something they recently learned.
This could be from ANY source — a book, podcast, YouTube video, conversation,
class, article, life experience, workshop, or their own reflection.

Your job:
1. Transcribe exactly what they said (if audio provided)
2. Extract actionable "priors" — principles they can practice in daily life

For each prior, provide:
- name: Short name (2-5 words)
- principle: The core insight in one sentence
- practice: A concrete way to practice this daily (specific, under 5 minutes)
- trigger: When/where in daily life to apply this
- source: What they were learning from

Return JSON:
{{
  "transcript": "exact words the user said",
  "title": "topic or source",
  "summary": "2-3 sentence summary",
  "priors": [
    {{
      "name": "...",
      "principle": "...",
      "practice": "...",
      "trigger": "...",
      "source": "..."

Extract 3-7 priors. Return ONLY valid JSON."""
